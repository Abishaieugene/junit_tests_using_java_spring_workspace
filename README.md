Hello everyone,

I've created a JUnit test that effectively tests Java programs. While it takes time to build, perform, and understand the concepts of JUnit testing, it's a valuable skill.

JUnit Framework Overview
JUnit is a free, open-source unit testing framework for Java, developed by Kent Beck and Erich Gamma. It's used to validate that each unit of software performs as expected, typically during the development phase.

Key Annotations and Assertions
Annotations: @Test, @ParameterizedTest, @ValueSource, @CsvSource, @Disabled
Assertions: assertEquals(), assertNotEquals(), assertTrue(), assertFalse(), assertNull(), assertNotNull(), assertThrows().

Project Dependencies
Spring Workspace
JUnit Testing Software

Give me a thumbs up if you like my work!

Thankyou.
